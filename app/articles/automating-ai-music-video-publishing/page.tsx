      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary">The Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Publishing AI-generated music videos on YouTube can easily consume hours per song. Manually combining audio with cover art, rendering the video, uploading to YouTube, formatting metadata, and scheduling releases turns into a full-day task when handling large volumes of content.
      </p>
      <p>
        This workflow eliminates that overhead by automating the entire pipeline. What once took a day now happens in minutes, producing consistent, high-quality videos on an intelligent schedule.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary">How the Workflow Works</h2>
      <p>
        The process starts with audio tracks from Suno and separately sourced cover art uploaded to Google Drive. Their presence triggers the workflow which proceeds through several stages:
      </p>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Input Stage</h3>
      <p>
        Audio and image files placed in Google Drive kick off the automation.
      </p>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">File Handling and Upsert</h3>
      <p>
        The workflow performs intelligent upsert operations on Drive to update files without creating duplicates.
      </p>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Media Processing</h3>
      <p>
        A FastAPI service combines the audio and image using FFmpeg, validating that the result is a proper video asset ready for YouTube.
      </p>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">YouTube Scheduling and Metadata Preparation</h3>
      <p>
        The workflow reads scheduled posts from a Google Sheet and calculates the next available slot at the brand&apos;s preferred timeâ€”3:33&nbsp;PM Hawaii Standard Time. Metadata like the title and tags are cleaned and validated to avoid API errors.
      </p>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Publishing</h3>
      <p>
        Finally, the validated video is uploaded to YouTube with the prepared metadata and scheduled publish date, and the Google Sheet is updated.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary">Key Features</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
        <li>End-to-end automation from raw audio and cover art to scheduled YouTube video</li>
        <li>Smart file upsert handling in Google Drive</li>
        <li>FastAPI-powered video generation with full validation</li>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary">The Result</h2>
      <p>
        This workflow creates a reliable AI music video publishing pipeline. What used to be a full day of manual effort per video now takes minutes, letting creators focus on producing content while maintaining a consistent release schedule.
