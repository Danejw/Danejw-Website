      <p>Crafting proposals, especially for grants or RFPs, can be slow and stressful due to research, formatting, and aligning with specific requirements.</p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Problem Example</h2>
      <p>Teams spend weeks rewriting bios, budgets, and impact statements across different applications—often duplicating work with slight variations for each submission.</p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">AI Solution Engineering</h2>
      <p>An AI co-pilot trained on past successful proposals and the current opportunity’s guidelines can auto-generate drafts, tailor content to requirements, and highlight gaps. It can also flag potential compliance issues or recommend phrasing tweaks to boost persuasiveness. This setup might use a mix of custom LLM fine-tuning, semantic search over previous submissions, and templates for consistent formatting.</p>
