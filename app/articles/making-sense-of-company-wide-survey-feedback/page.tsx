      <p>Organizations collect feedback through surveys but rarely act on it quickly due to the volume and lack of clarity.</p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Problem Example</h2>
      <p>A quarterly employee survey generates 1,000+ open-text responses. HR knows there are insights buried in the dataâ€”but manually reading and categorizing comments is time-consuming.</p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">AI Solution Engineering</h2>
      <p>A summarization and clustering pipeline can be built to ingest raw feedback, detect sentiment, categorize themes (e.g., compensation, culture, management), and auto-generate a report with data visualizations and quotes. You can use embeddings for grouping similar comments and plug into BI tools like Looker or Power BI for the output.</p>
